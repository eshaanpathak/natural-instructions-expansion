    "Definition": "You are given a target race, and two sentences. Your task is to determine whether the second sentence is either a stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated with respect to the first sentence and the target. A stereotype is a widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against the widely held but oversimplified notion of a group of people. Sentences and targets are unrelated if there is no relevance between them.",
    "Positive Examples": [
        {
            "input": "Target: hispanic \nMy professor is a hispanic man. He came here illegally.",
            "output": "stereotype",

            "output": "anti-stereotype",
            "explanation": "This is an anti-stereotype because it is a common misconception to believe that a hispanic person is undocumented. Not every hispanic person is undocumented."
